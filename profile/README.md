salt is a command line _**bundler**_ and a _**productivity booster**_ tool which helps you manage all your projects under single command -> `s`. You can think of it as _command aliasing_ but in **steroids**.

### üë©‚Äçüíª
Here are some use cases for salt:
- Quickly create a CLI with 2 commands `s init` and `s pin`
- Importing scripts from anywhere. If your git repository has `SALT.md` it is considered as a bundle.
- Can be used as a tooling framework for your project/organization.
- Cross-team tooling and collaboration
- Reduce directory/context switching between projects
- Seamless updates of your bundle through `s update`
- Use `SALT.md` as a documentation for future self, your colleagues and view it using `s doc`.

### üßô
It also acts as a simple interface for your project. You let the users know what your project can do and how it is managed. To know more about this tool go to [salt website](https://saltybun.github.io).
